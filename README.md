# ðŸ”  Character Segmentation OCR System

A simple OCR system focused on **character segmentation and recognition** using classical image processing and machine learning techniques.  
The project preprocesses images, segments characters, and classifies them using models like Logistic Regression.

## ðŸ§° Features
- Image loading from directory structures
- Preprocessing and resizing
- Character segmentation
- Feature extraction using PCA
- Classification using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python charsSeg.ipynb
